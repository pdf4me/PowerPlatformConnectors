## Nozbe API

The Nozbe API connector enables seamless integration between your workflows and the Nozbe productivity platform. With this connector, 
you can programmatically interact with Nozbe to automate task management, streamline team collaboration, and enhance your productivity systems.

Nozbe is designed to foster calm, focused, and deep workâ€”thanks to its task-based communication paradigm that replaces chaotic email threads and unnecessary meetings.

## Prerequisites

To use this connector, you'll need a valid **Nozbe API Key**.

You can sign up for a free Nozbe account at https://nozbe.app.
Once signed up, generate your API key by navigating to your account or space settings and locating the **Tokens API section**.
